# Advent_of_Code_2024

## Introduction

Welcome to my Advent of Code 2024 repository! Advent of Code is an annual event where programmers from around the world solve a series of daily coding puzzles throughout the month of December. I decided to take on this challenge to push myself and improve my coding skills. It's been a fun and rewarding way to test my problem-solving abilities and learn new concepts along the way. Throughout this repository, you will find my solutions to the puzzles, written in Python.

## Table of Contents

Each day contains two subfolders:
- Problem 1: The solution to the first problem of the day.
